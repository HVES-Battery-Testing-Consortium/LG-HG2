# Battery Testing Consortium (BTC)
The Battery Testing Consortium (BTC) has been developed within the High Voltage and Energy Storage Lab at Oxford Brookes University to provide accurate and comprehensive cell data to Formula Student Electric teams. Through the BTC, we aim to provide FS teams with information for improved and informed decisions for cell selection, pack architecture design, thermal cooling requirements, and end of life predictions. A range of tests are completed to provide a comprehensive electrochemical lithium-ion characterisation for modelling, validation, and battery management parameterisation.

This repository provides one open-source sample dataset of the larger consortium dataset. To join the consortium, visit the [HVES website].

## Notes
* For all tests dated before September 25th, 2021: Offset thermocouple measurements by 1.5째C (i.e. 30째C -> 28.5째C).
* Unless stated otherwise, all cells are stored in a controlled climate at 15째C.
